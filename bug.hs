This Haskell code attempts to use the `length` function on an infinite list, which will result in a non-terminating computation.

```haskell
import Prelude hiding (length)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let infiniteList = [1..]  -- Infinite list of integers
  print (length infiniteList) -- This will cause a stack overflow
```
